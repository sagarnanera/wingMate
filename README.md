## Requirements:

The system will have 4 types of user/roles: residents (simple user), house owner / family representative, wing admin, and secretory. It will also have 4 types of entities: user, house / family, wing, and society. Additionally, there will be 4 types of posts: image post (multiple image carousel), video post, text post, and GIF post.

The user will be able to create events and book wing/society properties for the same. Users have to pay the amount for attending events, and invitations will be sent after payment. There will be 4 types of wing/society properties: club house (1 in the whole society), terrace (1 per wing), wing office (1 per wing), and ground (1 per society).

Maintenance charges are due every month, and late payments will result in fines. The system will send maintenance charge reminders (if pending) to house owners. Users can also book properties for personal events (e.g., birthdays) or functions.
